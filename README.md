# Duke Nukem 3D ESP32 Port
An ESP32 port of Duke Nukem 3D - based on the Win/Mac/Linux port: Chocolate Duke3D (https://github.com/fabiensanglard/chocolate_duke3D)

## Requirements
- An ODROID-GO

or

- ESP32 WROVER (4Mb PSRAM)
- An SPI LCD screen - preferable using the ILI9341 chipset
- An SD Card and SPI or SDMMC reader
- Some input buttons

and

## SD Card Setup
On your SD Card, put all of the files from Duke Nukem 3D v1.5 (or lower) into a folder called "duke3d".

## ODROID-GO - Flash by Firmware File
- Copy /release/Duke3D.fw (https://github.com/jkirsons/Duke3D/raw/master/release/Duke3D.fw) from the GitHub repository to /odroid/firmware/Duke3D.fw on the SD Card.
- Power off the ODROID-GO, hold B, and power on the ODROID-GO.
- When the ODROID-GO menu displays, select Duke3D, press A, then press Start.
- It should take about 20 seconds to flash, and 30 seconds to load to the first intro screen.
